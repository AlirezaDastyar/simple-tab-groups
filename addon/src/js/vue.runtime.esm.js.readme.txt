The Vue framework does not have an official CDN. So I took the file "vue.runtime.esm.js" from the CDN which is listed on their official website:
https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#CDN

The file "vue.runtime.esm.js" has version 2.7.14, and downloaded from:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.7.14/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js

This is the stable Production version.

Best regards.
